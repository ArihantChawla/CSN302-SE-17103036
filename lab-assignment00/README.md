  I don't want to write a command line tool for this. Sure, I can give input messages etc. But I really don't want to. 
  Also format wasn't specified so I'm assuming you want CP based format
 
  INPUT  : 3 Space separated floating point numbers. 
  OUTPUT : 
       -1 -> Not a triangle
	0 -> Scalene triangle
	1 -> Right Angled triangle
	2 -> Isosceles triangle
	3 -> Equilateral triangle

Issues/Comments:
0. I'll be doing this assignment in python as it was the second language I had studied after C.
1. I'll be using trie becasue it's a radix tree (for prefix searching), rather than using the built-in dictionary. For this I'll use google's implementation of the same at https://pygtrie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
2. For GUI, I'll use the built in tk-inter. This is my first time actually making a GUI with tkinter. Usually I would use CGraphics or Django with some basic html.
